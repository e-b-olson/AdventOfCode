# Advent of Code 2022
  
This directory contains my solutions for [Advent of Code: 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).  
  
This year I wrote all my code in Python (3+).  
  
These are the **rough working files** I used during the challenge.  You'll find a lot of commented out code (mostly debug prints), some unused code, hard coded input file paths (I would just change them between test and real input files manually between runs)... there are even cases where the Part 1 code is commented out just to get the Part 2 answers (like, if Part 1 ran too long or mutated the input data, which messed with Part 2); *super* rough stuff.  You have been warned.
  
I learned a ton and had a lot of fun completing this year's challenge!  Thanks to all those who make [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) possible!
  
#### Note
  
I waited until after the challenge to post my code.
  
I've included input files (both test and actual) here as well.  But please be aware, if you attempt these challenges yourself, your input may be different from mine.
